# Snake

## Overview
This game Snake is just like the traditional game. The user controls a snake and tries to eat as many apples as possible.
Each apple the snake eats, the bigger the snake's body gets. If the snake hits itself or hits a wall, then it dies.
The main purpose is for the user to eat as many apples as possible while managing to not die, in spite of the snake's growing size.

## Instructions
Move the snake using "wasd" or the arrow keys. 
Eat apples by moving the snake's head over the red cubes.
If the snake's head is moved over its own body, it will die and the game will end.
If the snake's head runs into a wall, it will die and the game will end.
Eat as many apples as possible while staying alive.
The higher your score, the better.
